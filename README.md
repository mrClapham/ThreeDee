##ThreeDeeScene


Built on top of Mr Doob's Three.js, ThreeDeeScene is a wrapper to assist the quick creation of 3D scenes and apps using Three.js. It has the functionality you tend to need off-the-shelf baked into it, including mouseIn and mouseOut events and the ability to add listeners to those Events.

This is currently in Beta - but an Alpha release will follow shortly.
